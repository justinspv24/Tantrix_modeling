# Tantrix Puzzle Solver Using Integer Programming

## Description

This project presents a solution for the Tantrix puzzle using integer programming. The Tantrix puzzle is a strategic tile-laying game that involves arranging hexagonal tiles to form loops or paths of a single color. The solution leverages integer programming techniques to find optimal tile arrangements.

## Features

- **Hexagonal Grid Creation:** Generates a hexagonal grid to represent the puzzle layout.
- **Neighbor Edge Array Initialization:** Initializes an array to store information about neighboring hexagon edges.
- **Integer Programming Model:** Formulates the Tantrix puzzle as an integer programming problem.
- **Solution Visualization:** Visualizes the results of the solved puzzle.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `gurobipy`
- `hexalattice`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
